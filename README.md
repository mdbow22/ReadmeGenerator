# ReadMe Generator

## Description

This is a small app that helps generate a ReadMe file for your app. ReadMe is generated in GitHub friendly markdown and includes all major sections of a professional readme file and table of contents.

## Installation

Download a copy of the repository to your system (please do not clone to avoid accidentally overriding anything) and then in the command line run:

    npm install

This will install all needed dependencies.

## Usage

This can be used as a basic template for a readme file. You may need to add additional info after the creation if you have a more complex app.
